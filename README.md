### Project 1
Originally, this repo was for project 1. The records were stored in a struct and an array was created large enough to hold all the records. c_strings are used so "\0" was added to the end of each name. A basic display was created using iomanip.



### Project 4
Later on, Project 1 was cloned, changes were implemented and pushed back to the same repo. It was modified to use a dynamic array and utilize the **new** operator. All functions remained the same other than the readData and main. A switch was used for a menu of options for the user.
