CPSC 301 Section 1

Originally, this repo was for project 1. The records were stored in a struct and an array was created large enough to hold all the records. c_strings are used so "\0" was added to the end of each name. A basic display was created using iomanip.

Later on, project 4 was to clone project 1, implement changes, and push back to the same repo. It was modified to use a dynamic array and utilize the *new* operator. All functions remained the same other than the readData and main. A switch was then used for a menu.
